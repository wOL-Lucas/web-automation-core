## AUTH
### The local API that allows the communication between the user and the Chrome Extension uses a private key, a cert and a secret, that can be generated by the following commands, once you have openssh installed.

# Generate a private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out auth/key.pem

# Generate a self-signed certificate
openssl req -new -x509 -key auth/key.pem -out auth/cert.pem -days 365

# Generate a secret
openssl rand -base64 32 > auth/secret.pem
